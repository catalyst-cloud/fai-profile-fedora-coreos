FAI profile directory structure to install Fedora CoreOS.

FAI is the Fully Automatic Installer.  See https://fai-project.org .

This method of installing Fedora CoreOS is significantly faster than the PXE
boot method. You don't need to download an initrd that is over 600MB,
you can have a locally cached copy of the install image and you can easily
setup complicated disk configurations.

You need to add a copy of coreos-installer, see bin/README.

You need to place your Ignition file(s) in etc as $hostname.ign . If
the install device is not /dev/sda then add a class/$hostname.var file
setting INSTALL_DEVICE .

There are sample files in etc, class and disk_config for my-servers-hostname.

You may want to download a local copy of the install image, you can do
so by running the following in the basefiles directory of this FAI profile:

  cd basefiles && bin/coreos-installer download
